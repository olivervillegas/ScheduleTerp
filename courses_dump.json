These systems are inherently complex, owing to their (typically) high dimensionality and nonlinearity.  Hence, their exact solutions are difficult (if at all feasible) to obtain.    Consequently, these systems are generally studied using a combination of asymptotic analysis and numerical discretization approaches.  This course will cover a broad spectrum of techniques, theories and tools for modeling and analysing real-life phenomena arising in population biology, with emphasis on the study and asymptotic analysis of general classes of unstructured (single species discrete-time and continuous-time models, interacting populations etc.) and structured (spatially-structured, age-structured, sex-structured) population biology models arising in ecology and epidemiology.", "grading_method": ["Regular", "Audit"], "gen_ed": [], "core": [], "relationships": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "formerly": null, "restrictions": null, "additional_info": "Cross-listed with: AMSC721.", "also_offered_as": null, "credit_granted_for": "AMSC721 or BIOL721."}, "sections": ["BIOL721-0101"]}, "BIOL799": {"course_id": "BIOL799", "semester": "202308", "name": "Master's Thesis Research", "dept_id": "BIOL", "department": "Biology", "credits": "1", "description": "", "grading_method": ["Sat-Fail"], "gen_ed": [], "core": [], "relationships": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "formerly": null, "restrictions": null, "additional_info": null, "also_offered_as": null, "credit_granted_for": null}, "sections": []}, "BIOL898": {"course_id": "BIOL898", "semester": "202308", "name": "Pre-Candidacy Research", "dept_id": "BIOL", "department": "Biology", "credits": "1", "description": "", "grading_method": ["Regular"], "gen_ed": [], "core": [], "relationships": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "formerly": null, "restrictions": null, "additional_info": null, "also_offered_as": null, "credit_granted_for": null}, "sections": []}, "BIOL899": {"course_id": "BIOL899", "semester": "202308", "name": "Doctoral Dissertation Research", "dept_id": "BIOL", "department": "Biology", "credits": "6", "description": "", "grading_method": ["Sat-Fail"], "gen_ed": [], "core": [], "relationships": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "formerly": null, "restrictions": null, "additional_info": null, "also_offered_as": null, "credit_granted_for": null}, "sections": []}, "BIOM301": {"course_id": "BIOM301", "semester": "202308", "name": "Introduction to Biometrics", "dept_id": "BIOM", "department": "Biometrics", "credits": "3", "description": "Descriptive statistics, introduction to probability, sampling, confidence interval estimation, hypothesis testing, simple regression and correlation.

Diet can provide a simple solution to numerous health issues. So, why do many people fail to follow this seemingly simple solution and still suffer from obesity and other diet-related diseases? Diet is a topic that most people know but few people understand. In addition, diet has become one of the most important lenses for looking at a variety of social, economic, and cultural issues. Since the concept of diet is continuum and has multifaceted aspects, we need to understand it in broad and multidisciplinary perspectives including social, cultural and economic aspects.", "grading_method": ["Regular", "Audit"], "gen_ed": [["DSSP", "SCIS"]], "core": [], "relationships": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "formerly": null, "restrictions": null, "additional_info": null, "also_offered_as": null, "credit_granted_for": null}, "sections": ["NFSC220-0101"]}, "NFSC298": {"course_id": "NFSC298", "semester": "202308", "name": "Sports Nutrition Internship Practicum", "dept_id": "NFSC", "department": "Nutrition and Food Science", "credits": "1", "description": "", "grading_method": ["Sat-Fail"], "gen_ed": [], "core": [], "relationships": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "formerly": null, "restrictions": null, "additional_info": null, "also_offered_as": null, "credit_granted_for": null}, "sections": ["NFSC298-0101"]}, "NFSC350": {"course_id": "NFSC350", "semester": "202308", "name": "Foodservice Operations", "dept_id": "NFSC", "department": "Nutrition and Food Science", "credits": "5", "description": "Introduction to management.
